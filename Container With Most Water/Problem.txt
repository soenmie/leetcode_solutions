Given n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, a_i). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, a_i) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
